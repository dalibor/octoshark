Octoshark is a simple ActiveRecord connection manager. It provides connection switching mechanisms that can be used in various scenarios like master-slave, sharding or multi-tenant architecture.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'octoshark'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install octoshark
```


## Usage

Octoshark has two connection managers: `ConnectionPoolsManager` for managing connection pools using persistent connections and `ConnectionManager` for managing non-persistent connections. It depends on your application performance and scaling requirements which one to use.

- If you have a limited number of consumers (application and worker servers), `ConnectionPoolsManager` would be the preferred option. Standard Rails application has a single connection pool, and `ConnectionPoolsManager` just makes it possible for application models to work with multiple connection pools.

- If you have a very big infrastructure with lots of consumers (application and worker servers) and you are hitting max connections limit on database servers, i.e. you need to scale horizontally, `ConnectionManager` is the option to use. Because it uses non-persistent connections it comes up with a performance penalty because connections are re-established over and over again. Some ActiveRecord plugins that depend on having an active database connection all the time might need a change in order to work with non-persistent connections.

`ConnectionPoolsManager` and `ConnectionManager` can be combined together and many of them can be used at the same time.

Here is how to create connection pools manager:

```ruby
CONN_MANAGER = Octoshark::ConnectionPoolsManager.new({ c1: config1, c2: config2 })
```

`config1` and `config2` are standard ActiveRecord database configs:

```ruby
config = {
  adapter:  'mysql2',
  host:     'localhost',
  port:     3306,
  database: 'database',
  username: 'root',
  password: 'pass',
  pool:     1,
  encoding: 'utf8',
}
```

To switch a connection using a specific pool:

```ruby
CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(:c1) do |connection|
  connection.execute("SELECT 1")
end
```

Multiple `with_connection` blocks can be nested:

```ruby
CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(config1) do
  # run queries on connection specified with config1

  CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(config2) do
    # run queries on connection specified with config2
  end

  # run queries on connection specified with config1
end
```

If you establish a connection to database server instead of to database, then you can use the second optional argument `database_name` to tell the connection manager to switch the connection to that database within the same connection. This is useful when you want to have fewer connection pools and keep number of active connection per database server under control. This option is only MySQL specific for now, it uses `USE database_name` statement to switch the connection.

```ruby
CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(:c1, database_name) do |connection|
  connection.execute("SELECT 1")
end
```

Using non-persistent connections with `Octoshark::ConnectionManager` has the same API:


```ruby
CONN_MANAGER = Octoshark::ConnectionManager.new
```

Opening a new connection, executing query and closing the connection:

```ruby
CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(config) do |connection|
  connection.execute("SELECT 1")
end
```


## Using Octoshark with ActiveRecord models

To tell an ActiveRecord model to use the Octoshark connection we can override the `Model.connection` method.

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  class << self
    def connection
      CONN_MANAGER.current_connection
    end

    # For Rails 7.2+ we need to override the following methods too:

    def lease_connection
      connection
    end

    def with_connection
      yield connection
    end

    def schema_cache
      connection.schema_cache
    end
  end
end
```

To use a specific database connection:

```ruby
CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(:c1) do
  # run queries on c1
  Post.first
end
```

This connection switching in Rails applications is usually done from within an `around_filter` for controllers and in a similar way for other application "entry-points" like background jobs:

```ruby
around_filter :select_shard

def select_shard(&block)
  CONN_MANAGER.with_connection(current_user.shard, &block)
end
```

`CONN_MANAGER.current_connection` returns the active connection while the execution is in the `with_connection` block or raises `Octoshark::Error::NoCurrentConnection` outside of the `with_connection` block. In some cases, falling back to the default database connection for the Rails app might be preferable which can be done using `CONN_MANAGER.current_or_default_connection`.


## Octoshark::ConnectionPoolsManager.reset_connection_managers!

When using `Octoshark::ConnectionPoolsManager`, whenever ActiveRecord::Base calls `establish_connection` (usually by an ancestor process that must have subsequently forked), `Octoshark.reset_connection_managers!` is automatically called to re-establish the Octoshark connections. It prevents `ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished` in the scenarios like:

* Unicorn before/after fork
* Spring prefork/serve
* Some rake tasks like `rake db:test:prepare`


## Cleaning test databases

For `Octoshark::ConnectionPoolsManager`, we can use [DatabaseCleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) and RSpec like:

```ruby
config.before(:suite) do
  setup_database_cleaner
  DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
end

config.before(:each) do
  setup_database_cleaner
  DatabaseCleaner.start
end

config.after(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:transaction)
end

def setup_database_cleaner
  DatabaseCleaner[:active_record, {connection: ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool}]
  Octoshark::ConnectionPoolsManager.connection_managers.each do |manager|
    manager.connection_pools.each_pair do |connection_name, connection_pool|
      DatabaseCleaner[:active_record, {connection: connection_pool}]
    end
  end
end
```

For `Octoshark::ConnectionManager` where connections and databases are dynamically created and cannot be configured in the test setup, we can write a custom database cleaner inspired by [DatabaseRewinder](https://github.com/amatsuda/database_rewinder). The example below is for a multi-tenant test setup with a main (core) database and a tenant database for the `CURRENT_USER` in the test suite. `CustomDatabaseCleaner.clean_all` cleans all core database tables before test suite and `CustomDatabaseCleaner.clean` cleans used tables in both core and tenant databases after each test.


```ruby
module CustomDatabaseCleaner
  INSERT_REGEX = /\AINSERT(?:\s+IGNORE)?\s+INTO\s+(?:\.*[`"]?(?<table>[^.\s`"]+)[`"]?)*/i

  @@tables_with_inserts = []

  class << self
    def record_inserted_table(connection, sql)
      match = sql.match(INSERT_REGEX)

      if match && match[:table] && tables_with_inserts.exclude?(match[:table])
        tables_with_inserts << match[:table]
      end
    end

    def clean_all
      with_core_db_connection do |connection|
        clean_tables(connection)
      end

      reset_tables_with_inserts
    end

    def clean
      with_core_db_connection do |connection|
        clean_tables(connection, { 'users' => [CURRENT_USER.id] })
      end

      CURRENT_USER.with_tenant do |connection|
        clean_tables(connection)
      end

      reset_tables_with_inserts
    end

    private
    def with_core_db_connection(&block)
      CoreDBManager.with_connection(ActiveRecord::Base.configurations[Rails.env].symbolize_keys, &block)
    end

    def clean_tables(connection, keep_data = {})
      tables_to_clean = connection.tables.reject { |t| t == ActiveRecord::Migrator.schema_migrations_table_name }
      tables_to_clean = tables_to_clean & tables_with_inserts if tables_with_inserts.present?

      tables_to_clean.each do |table|
        connection.disable_referential_integrity do
          table_name = connection.quote_table_name(table)
          keep_ids   = keep_data[table]

          if keep_ids
            connection.execute("DELETE FROM #{table_name} WHERE id NOT IN (#{keep_ids.join(',')});")
          else
            connection.execute("DELETE FROM #{table_name};")
          end
        end
      end
    end

    def reset_tables_with_inserts
      @@tables_with_inserts = []
    end

    def tables_with_inserts
      @@tables_with_inserts
    end
  end
end

module CustomDatabaseCleaner
  module InsertRecorder
    def execute(sql, *)
      CustomDatabaseCleaner.record_inserted_table(self, sql)
      super
    end

    def exec_query(sql, *)

  end
end
